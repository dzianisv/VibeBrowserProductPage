# VibeBrowser Growth & Promotion Tracker

## Positioning

**Core message:** 90% cheaper than Browserbase — because you don't need stealth mode to access your own accounts.

**Key insight:** Browserbase/Browserless solve the *scraping strangers' sites* problem (bot detection, stealth, CAPTCHAs, proxies). VibeBrowser solves a different problem: automating *your own* workflows where you're already a legitimate user. No stealth = dramatically cheaper.

**Differentiators:**
- Local-first (Chrome extension, free, no account)
- Cloud when you need it (VibeBrowser Cloud — your real session, globally deployed)
- Open source MCP: `npx @vibebrowser/mcp`
- Works with Claude, Copilot, Codex, Gemini CLI
- No per-hour billing traps, no proxy costs, no CAPTCHA fees

## Content / SEO

| Content | Status | PR | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blog: Browserbase vs VibeBrowser (local+cloud) | ✅ Live | #88 merged | Includes competitor pain points, billing trap section, dev quote, updated comparison table |
| VibeBrowser MCP + Chrome DevTools fallback | ✅ Live | #85 merged | Technical SEO for "browser MCP" and "CDP fallback" queries |
| `public/llms.txt` | ✅ Updated | — | `/cloud` and both blog posts added |

### Competitor pain points to use in copy (from research, 2026-04-28)
1. **Billing traps** — 1-min minimum billing, 5-sec health checks burn credits; surprise proxy overages
2. **Auth re-auth hell** — Long-running authenticated sessions randomly drop CDP connections
3. **Infrastructure babysitting** — Silent session deaths, container management, debugging mid-session drops; users become part-time DevOps
4. **Bot detection arms race** — Rotating proxies, CAPTCHA solving, fingerprint mgmt steal time from building
5. **Useless free tiers** — Browserbase: 1 browser hour *total*. Browserless: ~8 hours then pay
6. **Wrong tool entirely** — Built for anonymous scraping; users paying for stealth they don't need

> **Killer quote** (paraphrased from r/automation): "I became a part-time DevOps engineer babysitting containers that would silently die mid-session."

> **Killer insight:** Both competitors assume you're a *bot pretending to be human*. VibeBrowser's premise is that you're already human — use your real session. That makes 80% of their feature stack irrelevant.

## Community / Traffic Channels

### Hacker News

**Post:** [Show HN: VibeBrowser – Give your AI agent your real logged-in browser via MCP](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47931565)
**Status:** ✅ Live — posted 2026-04-28
**Why HN:** HN's "Show HN" format is the most legitimate way for a builder to share a new open-source tool. The audience is technical, skeptical of marketing, and actively interested in AI agent tooling. Leading with `npx @vibebrowser/mcp` and the CDP/auth-loop technical story is exactly what HN responds to. A single genuine Show HN can drive 500–5000 qualified visitors in 24 hours if it gains traction.
**Angle used:** "I built this after getting frustrated with the fresh-anonymous-browser problem — agents lose all your sessions on every run. VibeBrowser connects to your *existing* Chrome." Technical, honest, open-source invite.

---

### Reddit

**Account in use:** `Icy_Host_1975`
**Known bans:** r/LocalLLaMA (banned — cannot post)

| Subreddit | Post title | Status | URL | Why this subreddit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| r/LocalLLaMA | "I built a browser MCP that gives your local LLM your real logged-in Chrome — free, no Browserbase account" | ❌ Banned | — | Best audience fit but account is banned. Try with different account or appeal ban. |
| r/SideProject | Same angle | 📋 Ready to post | — | Self-promotion welcome, no restrictions. Good fallback for r/LocalLLaMA. |
| r/ClaudeAI | "Give Claude Code your real browser via MCP (free extension)" | 📋 Planned | — | Claude Code has native MCP support — users already looking for MCP tools |
| r/ChatGPTCoding | TBD | 📋 Planned | — | Codex CLI users; same MCP angle |
| r/LangChain | TBD | 📋 Planned | — | Agent framework users who wire browser tools; direct fit |
| r/webdev | TBD | 📋 Planned | — | Broader dev audience; lead with open-source + free angle, not AI |

**Reddit strategy:** Never post the product page directly. Share the blog post or frame it as "I built this". One post per subreddit, days apart. Respond to every comment within the first hour — HN and Reddit rank by engagement velocity.

#### ⚠️ Post-mortem: what went wrong with Icy_Host_1975 (2026-04-28)

Account audit revealed a classic astroturfing pattern that got the account flagged and banned from r/LocalLLaMA:

**Root causes:**

1. **Too low karma (16)** — r/LocalLLaMA and r/MachineLearning require ~50–100+ karma. Comments auto-removed by filter.
2. **Product name in every comment** — every reply mentioned "vibe browser" or "openclaw.vibebrowser.app". Two comments removed by mods (r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA).
3. **Wrong subreddit entirely** — agent posted browser automation promo in **r/womenintech**. Got **−5 downvotes**, 366 views. Completely off-topic. This alone flags the account as a spammer to Reddit's algorithm.
4. **Too many subreddits too fast** — 7 comments across 8 different subs in 48 hours from a 16-karma account. Classic coordinated promotion signal.
5. **Comment drops, not genuine engagement** — technically plausible replies that always steered toward the product. Mods recognise this pattern immediately.

**Rules for future agent-assisted posting:**

- ✅ **Minimum 100 karma** before any promotional activity in high-signal subs (r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning, r/ClaudeAI)
- ✅ **2-week warm-up** — genuine comments only (no product mention) before first promo post
- ✅ **One product mention per 24h max** per account
- ✅ **Use the builder's real account** (`u/dzianisv` or equivalent) — credibility beats anonymity
- ✅ **Only link the product in top-level posts** where self-promotion is explicitly allowed ("I built this", "Show r/...")
- ❌ **Never post in off-topic subs** just to build karma — it backfires badly
- ❌ **Never let an agent auto-post without human review** of the draft first

### Blog posts (SEO + shareable content)

| Post | Status | URL | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Browserbase vs VibeBrowser: local-first vs cloud-only | ⏳ PR #88 pending | `/blog/browserbase-vs-vibebrowser-local-and-cloud` | Captures "Browserbase alternative" search traffic. Educational tone means it gets shared, not flagged as spam. Comparison tables rank well in Google. |
| VibeBrowser MCP + Chrome DevTools fallback | ✅ Live | `/blog/implementing-vibebrowser-mcp-cli-chrome-devtools-fallback` | Technical SEO for "browser MCP" and "CDP fallback" queries |

### Planned channels (not started)
- [ ] Twitter/X thread — local vs cloud angle + competitor pricing breakdown (thread format performs well)
- [ ] Dev.to / Hashnode — cross-post the Browserbase comparison article (separate SEO juice)
- [ ] Product Hunt launch (coordinate hero image, tagline, hunter outreach — separate planning needed)

### X / Twitter

**Account:** `@whoisdzianis` (builder's real account — use this, not throwaway accounts)

#### ⚠️ Account status note
A separate X account used for automated promotion was banned. Likely triggers:
- **New account posting promotional links immediately** — X's spam detection is aggressive for accounts with no follower history posting product URLs
- **Automated posting patterns** — identical phrasing, no engagement history, no followers = instant flag
- **No prior community presence** — X requires social proof (followers, replies, likes received) before promotional posts get reach

**Rules for X:**
- ✅ Use `@whoisdzianis` (real identity, existing followers)
- ✅ Thread format — lead with the insight/rant, product comes at the end
- ✅ Engage first — reply to MCP / browser automation threads for 1 week before any product thread
- ✅ Quote-tweet relevant threads rather than posting cold
- ❌ Never create a new account just for promotion — gets banned within hours
- ❌ Never auto-post without reviewing draft first
